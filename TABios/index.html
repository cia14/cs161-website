                Hi all, Jesse Chick here. I graduated from Tualatin High School in 2016 and am currently a junior in the Honors College and computer science professional school. I am currently involved in two reseach projects which are aimed at applying machine learning to computer security systems. Feel free to ask me questions about this class, your Honors thesis, machine leanring/AI, the MECOP program--I will be starting my second internship this summer--or anything else which might come up. My favorite aspect of this job is getting to meet and work with a new crew of students every term so don't be a stranger!
